    "text": "there was once a woman who was very, very cheerful, though she had little to make her so; for she was old, and poor, and lonely. she lived in a little bit of a cottage and earned a scant living by running errands for her neighbours, getting a bite here, a sup there, as reward for her services. so she made shift to get on, and always looked as spry and cheery as if she had not a want in the world. now one summer evening, as she was trotting, full of smiles as ever, along the high road to her hovel, what should she see but a big black pot lying in the ditch!  godness me! she cried, that would be just the very thing for me if i only had something to put in it! but i havent! now who could have left it in the ditch?"

    "text": "johnny town-mouse was born in a cupboard. timmy willie was born in a garden. timmy willie was a little country mouse who went to town by mistake in a hamper. the gardener sent vegetables to town once a week by carrier; he packed them in a big hamper. the gardener left the hamper by the garden gate, so that the carrier could pick it up when he passed. timmy willie crept in through a hole in the wicker-work, and after eating some peas—timmy willie fell fast asleep. he awoke in a fright, while the hamper was being lifted into the carriers cart. then there was a jolting, and a clattering of horses feet; other packages were thrown in; for miles and miles—jolt—jolt—jolt! and timmy willie trembled amongst the jumbled up vegetables. at last the cart stopped at a house, where the hamper was taken out, carried in, and set down. the cook gave the carrier sixpence; the back door banged, and the cart rumbled away. but there was no quiet; there seemed to be hundreds of carts passing. dogs barked; boys whistled in the street; the cook laughed, the parlour maid ran up and down-stairs; and a canary sang like a steam engine"
